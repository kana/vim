INDEX OF HACKS						*hacks-index*

Fix behavior 'foldopen' on search	     *hacks-bugfix-foldopen-on-search*
	Whenever '/' or '?' is used and the cursor is moved in closed folds,
	the folds will be opened (see also 'foldopen').  Vim checks whether
	'/' or '?' has been invoked via a key mapping, if so, Vim will not
	open folds.  But Vim also checks how {pattern} for '/' or '?' has been
	inputted, via a key mapping or not.  It seems to be strange and it
	annoys some people who love to input <Enter> with other key such as
	Semicolon key.  Fix this behavior, so Vim doesn't check on {pattern}.

|gettabvar()|/|settabvar()|				*hacks-tabvar-func*
	Functions to get/set tabpage-local variables.

Auto setting 'paste'					*hacks-autopaste*
	When input text seems to be pasted, set 'paste' automatically.
	The conditions are:
	1) the length of input text is greater than 10 bytes, and
	2) input text contains at least 1 carriage return ("\r").

	Note that this hack doesn't unset 'paste' automatically.  So you have
	to add the following setting in your |vimrc|:
>
		autocmd InsertLeave *  set nopaste
<

|NCmdUndefined|						*hacks-ncmdundefined*
	Autocommand event for typeing a key which is not mapped to any Normal
	mode command.

|v:motion_force|				   *hacks-vimvar-motion_force*
	New predefined variable to contains the information about |o_v| and
	others to force a motion.

					   *hacks-bugfix-syntax-vim-iskeyword*
Fix overriding 'iskeyword' in syntax/vim.vim
	Fix the bug that syntax/vim.vim overrides the global value of
	'iskeyword' after including syntax/scheme.vim.
