INDEX OF HACKS						*hacks-index*

							*hacks-bugfix-runtime*
Fix misc. bugs in runtime files
	Fix wrong handling 'iskeyword' in 7 runtime files.  Especially, they
	set the local value of 'iskeyword' AND the global value of
	'iskeyword', but the latter must not be modified.  Because it causes
	unexpected 'iskeyword' value for newly created buffers.  Also, fix the
	way to refer the local value of 'iskeyword' not to be misread:

		runtime/autoload/ada.vim
		runtime/autoload/sqlcomplete.vim
		runtime/autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim
		runtime/autoload/xmlcomplete.vim
		runtime/ftplugin/man.vim
		runtime/syntax/sdl.vim
		runtime/syntax/vim.vim
