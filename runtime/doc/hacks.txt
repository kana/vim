INDEX OF HACKS						*hacks-index*

Fix behavior 'foldopen' on search	     *hacks-bugfix-foldopen-on-search*
	Whenever '/' or '?' is used and the cursor is moved in closed folds,
	the folds will be opened (see also 'foldopen').  Vim checks whether
	'/' or '?' has been invoked via a key mapping, if so, Vim will not
	open folds.  But Vim also checks how {pattern} for '/' or '?' has been
	inputted, via a key mapping or not.  It seems to be strange and it
	annoys some people who love to input <Enter> with other key such as
	Semicolon key.  Fix this behavior, so Vim doesn't check on {pattern}.

|gettabvar()|/|settabvar()|				*hacks-tabvar-func*
	Functions to get/set tabpage-local variables.

Auto setting 'paste'					*hacks-autopaste*
	When input text seems to be pasted, set 'paste' automatically.
	The conditions are:
	1) the length of input text is greater than 10 bytes, and
	2) input text contains at least 1 carriage return ("\r").

	Note that this hack doesn't unset 'paste' automatically.  So you have
	to add the following setting in your |vimrc|:
>
		autocmd InsertLeave *  set nopaste
<

|NCmdUndefined|						*hacks-ncmdundefined*
	Autocommand event for typeing a key which is not mapped to any Normal
	mode command.

|v:motion_force|				   *hacks-vimvar-motion_force*
	New predefined variable to contains the information about |o_v| and
	others to force a motion.

					   *hacks-bugfix-syntax-vim-iskeyword*
Fix overriding 'iskeyword' in syntax/vim.vim
	Fix the bug that syntax/vim.vim overrides the global value of
	'iskeyword' after including syntax/scheme.vim.

							*hacks-bugfix-runtime*
Fix misc. bugs in runtime files
	Fix wrong handling 'iskeyword' in 7 runtime files.  Especially, they
	set the local value of 'iskeyword' AND the global value of
	'iskeyword', but the latter must not be modified.  Because it causes
	unexpected 'iskeyword' value for newly created buffers.  Also, fix the
	way to refer the local value of 'iskeyword' not to be misread:

		runtime/autoload/ada.vim
		runtime/autoload/sqlcomplete.vim
		runtime/autoload/syntaxcomplete.vim
		runtime/autoload/xmlcomplete.vim
		runtime/ftplugin/man.vim
		runtime/syntax/sdl.vim
		runtime/syntax/vim.vim

|<AbbrExpand>|						*hacks-<AbbrExpand>*
	Pseudo key like |i_CTRL-]| which triggers abbreviation without
	inserting a character.  The difference is that |<AbbrExpand>|
	triggers abbreviation even if it is used via key mappings.
